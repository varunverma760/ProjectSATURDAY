# Project SATURDAY  
Your everyday Newsreader, the leading initiative towards outright social awareness!

### Problem Statement:  
Being aware of the news from around the globe may prove to be very crucial, especially in these unprecedented times. It is even more unfair for people suffering from vision disorders and difficulties like dyslexia to keep up with the times in such a text-oriented online environment. Hence, we implemented Project SATURDAY, that can immensely ease the quality of life for such people.
Project SATURDAY is a unique responsive project which scours through trusted news sources and reads them out to the user. With the availability of voice command, users can enjoy the fruits of cutting edge Natural Language Processing technology and converse with SATURDAY regarding latest freshly baked news from reputable news sources like BBC and CNN.  
This project is a demo and was made for participation in Hack the Mountains 2.0 Hackathon. 

_The Background says JARVIS because why not?_

### Challanges Faced:   
Application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Alan Ai was a new domain for us and trying to link it to our project was the prime hurdle we faced while building this project. 

### Techstack:
